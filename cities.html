                        <h1>Cities</h1>
                        <p>Currently, about 1 in 2 people live in cities and with rapid urbanization in the developing world it is expected that by 2050, 7 in 10 people will reside in cities.
                            I deeply care about making cities livable, equitable, sustainable and resilient. Whether that is to do with transportation, housing, public spaces, climate change, or crime, I am passionate about making cities better places to live in.
                            With this goal, my research has been focussed on exploring how machine learning can help us build better and more resilient cities.

                        <p>I have not yet found the city that I would like to call home. However, here are some cool cities that I have had a chance to visit and found to be beautiful.</p>
