Hi, I am Gaurav!

I'm a rising senior at [Duke](https://duke.edu/) and [Duke Kunshan](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/)  studying Computer Science and Statistics with an Interdisplinary Major in Data Science. Previously, I interned at the [National Stock Exchange](https://www.nseindia.com/) where I investigated anomaly detection algorithms.

I am currently doing research in Causal Inference as a part of the [AME Lab](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/) at Duke, being advised by [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) and [Dr. Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/). 

Prior to my time at Duke, I attended the [Mahindra United World College](https://uwcmahindracollege.org) and am proud to be part of the [UWC Movement](https://www.uwc.org/). 

I also work part time in the Venue and Production Management Department at Duke where I manage Front of House activities and get to enjoy dance, theatre and music performances.
