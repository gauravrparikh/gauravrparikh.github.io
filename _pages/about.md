Hello World, I am Gaurav!

I'm a rising senior at [Duke](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) and [Duke Kunshan](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/)  studying Computer Science and Statistics with an IDM in Data Science. Previously, I interned at the [National Stock Exchange](https://www.nseindia.com/) where I investigatged anomaly detection algorithms.

I am currently doing research in Causal Inference as a part of the [AME Lab](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/) at Duke, being advised by [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) and [Dr. Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/). 

Part time, I also work in the Venue and Production Management Department at Duke where I manage Front of House activities and get to enjoy dance, theatre and music performances from leading artists.
