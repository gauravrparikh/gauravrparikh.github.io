Hi, I am Gaurav ðŸ‘‹!

I'm a graduate student at [Duke](https://duke.edu/)ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ studying Computer Science.

In Summer 2021, interned at the [National Stock Exchange](https://www.nseindia.com/) where I investigated anomaly detection algorithms.

I am currently doing research in Causal Inference as a part of the [AME Lab](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/) at Duke, being advised by [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/home.html). 

I am also interested in machine learning applications in biomedicine, healthcare and precision medicine.

Prior to my time at Duke, I attended the [Mahindra United World College](https://uwcmahindracollege.org)ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ and am proud to be part of the [UWC Movement](https://www.uwc.org/).
