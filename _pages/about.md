Hi, I'm Soham!

I'm a rising junior at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) studying Computer Science. My current research interests span Machine Learning, Cryptography and their intersectection (aka Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning). I'm a part of the [MPhasis Lab](https://ashoka.edu.in/ML2CT) at Ashoka, being advised by [Dr. Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home) and [Dr. Subhashis Banerjee](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~suban/). Previously, I've been a part of [BharatSim](https://www.thoughtworks.com/engineering-research/bharatsim) and [CiPHER](https://cipher.ashoka.edu.in/en/) under [Dr. Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com/).

Beyond academics, I'm a competent artist, photographer, archer and an incompetent pianist. I've also been into cooking recently. 

I grew up in Kolkata and did my primary schooling from [The Heritage School](https://www.theheritageschool.org/), Kolkata, IN.
